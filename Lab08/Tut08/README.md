# Tutorial 07

 - Design principles

## Activities

### Activity 1

Break up into your project groups. Spend 10 minutes together as a team looking through your iteration 2 code. Identify a segment of a file in your repository that you think is a design smell. After 10 minutes, your tutor will ask each group to point out the file/line(s) of where this is, what you think is wrong with it, and how you would improve the code design. Discuss as a class.

### Activity 2

A simple piece of code `box.py` that generates an ASCII box has been provided. What are possible code smells with this code? How would you refactor it to be more consistent with basic software engineering design principles?

### Activity 3

A simple piece of code `bubble.py` that uses bubble sort to sort numbers passed in via argv has been provided. What are possible code smells with this code? How would you refactor it to be more consistent with basic software engineering design principles?

### Activity 4

Use top-down thinking to implement a registration function in `register.py` for an social network where a new user enters a username, password, and the repeat password. To successfully register users must:
 * Enter a username that is not already taken
 * Enter a password of minimum 10 characters
 * Both password and repeat password match
