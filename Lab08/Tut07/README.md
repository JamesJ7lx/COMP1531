# Tutorial 6

## A. Estimation

The following user stories are from the lecture estimation exercise. In groups of 4 or 5 (different to your project teams), use planning poker to come up with your own point estimates for each story. Like in the lecture, the first story has been given an initial point value to act as a baseline. Unlike in the lecture, you should do this one story at a time. Don't progress to the next story till you've all agreed on an estimate for the current story.

* > As a company, I want to post job openings so that suitable candidates can find out about them

    Story points = 5

* > As a jobseeker, I want to search for jobs by attributes like location, salary range, job title, company name, and the date the job was posted, so that I can find jobs which meet my basic criteria

    Story points = ?

* > As a jobseeker, I want to view information about each job that is matched by a search, so that I can make an informed decision whether I want to apply

    Story points = ?

* > As a jobseeker I want to view detailed information about a company that has posted a job, so that I can determine if it is somewhere I want to work

    Story points = ?

* > As a jobseeker, I want to put in an applications for jobs I'm interested in, so that I can make companies aware of my suitability for a job

    Story points = ?

Once done, as a class, discuss the following questions:

* How close were your initial estimates?
* How many rounds did it take for them to converge?
* Did the number of rounds decrease as you estimated more stories?

## B. Measures

Discuss the following project-related measures and answer the questions below:

* The bus factor: the *minimum* number of people that would need to be hit by a bus for a project to fail.
* Group intercommunication: How many possible channels of communication there are between `n` team members. Defined as `n(n âˆ’ 1) / 2`, or the number of edges in the complete graph with `n` nodes.
* Lines of Code: The number of lines of code (usually not including comments) in a codebase.

1. Are their scales nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, or absolute?
2. What meaning can we infer from them?
3. Do they have a value or range that makes an appropriate target?
4. What are the results of applying them to your project?

## C. Cyclomatic complexity

For the following python functions, calculate their cyclomatic complexity.

```python
def foo():
    if A:
        if B:
            C
        else:
            D
    E
```

```python
def bar():
    while A:
        B
    if C:
        D
    E
```

```python
def baz():
    if A:
        if B:
            if C:
                D
    E
```

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        prime = False
    elif n <= 3:
        prime = True
    elif n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        prime = False
    else:
        prime = True
        i = 5
        while i*i <= n and prime:
            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
                prime = False
            i += 6
    return prime
```
