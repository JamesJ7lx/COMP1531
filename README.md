# COMP1531

## Software Engineering Fundamentals

## Course Summary

This course is teaches students about software engineering principles via exposure to the important practice of building correct products in effectively functioning teams.

The students are exposed to agile software practices, team collaboration and effective communication through implementing a group project based on agile software methodologies that requires them to analyse, design, build and deploy a web-based application. This course is typically taken in the semester after completing COMP 1511, but could be delayed and taken later. It provides essential background for the teamwork and project management required in many later courses.
The goal of this course is to expose the students to:

Demonstrating effective use of the python programming language
Basic elements of software engineering - derived from the life-cycle of a software system, including requirements elicitation, analysis and specification; design; construction; verification and validation; deployment;
Software engineering methodologies, processes, tools and techniques
Agile software, collaboration and communication practices
Web-based system architecture and development practices on web platforms

## Assumed Knownledge

We assume all students have completed COMP1511 (or equivalent).
Students should be familiar with the basic concepts of programming, including loops, functions, libraries of code, compiling, and writing code to follow specifications.

## Student Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, students will be able to:

Identify the complexities of software design and development
Analyse a problem domain and elicit user requirement, user stories, and use cases
Understand modern tools available to engage in deployment of web-based applications
Demonstrate effective use of applying the python programming language to solve problems
Demonstrate proficiency in use of system schematics, data modelling, and conceptual modelling, to analyse complex software systems
Demonstrate effective usage of testing fundamentals (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, test plan/cases, test automation)
Describe the phases of software development and life-cycle of software - and illustrate them from experience
Reflect on the choice of software engineering methodology (e.g, waterfall, agile) used in a project
Understand agile software development practices and conducting analysis, design, implementation and testing in the context of an agile framework
Describe common behavior that contribute to the effective functioning of a team and identify necessary roles in a software development team based on agile software practices
Understand and apply Git as a source code management tool and as a medium for collaborating in the development of software applications

## Teaching Strategies

This course uses the standard set of practice-focused teaching strategies employed by most CSE foundational courses:

Lectures
Tutorials and Lab sessions
Major Project
This course aims to provide the students with a strong foundation in the fundamental principles and practices of software engineering that will prepare them for the advanced software engineering workshops. As such, a broad range of key software engineering topics will be taught and reinforced through a group project, that will enable students to apply the theoretical concepts acquired to solve a practical software engineering problem. An agile software delivery style has been chosen for the implementation of the group project, to make students familiar with modern agile development methodologies.

Each tute-lab session will comprise a 1 hour tutorial followed by a 2 hour practical lab session. These sessions commence from week 1 .
