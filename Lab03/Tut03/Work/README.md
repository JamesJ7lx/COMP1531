# Tutorial 1

 - Requirements
 - User stories
 - Dictionary questions
 - pyTest questions
 - Agile questions

## A. Requirements

Your tutor may break you up into groups to complete this activity.

* Q. What are attributes of good requirements?
* Q. How could we clean this up into well described requirements? "I want a burger with lots of pickles and mayo but I need to make sure that the mayo doesn't make the burger bun really wet. Oh, and it needs t obe warm, like, made less than 5 minutes ago warm but not so hot that I burn myself. I'm also not a big fan of plastic containers so if it could be in a paper bag that would be good. Actually, make that a brown paper bag, I like the colour of that"

## B. User Stories

Pick 3 people from the class. These students will be come our "end-users".

These 3 students have asked for a "to-do list" app/product - something that is better than all of the other to-do list products out there. These 3 students should brainstorm quickly about what they would want to see in a to-do list app built for them.

Your tutor will work with you and the remaining students to interview/question these students to write a series of user stories for this to-do list app.

## C. Agile

Each group should share their current plans/methods in terms of:
 * When (or if) they are running standups and whether they are synchronous or asynchronous
 * How often they meet, how they meet, and what the goals/outcomes of any meetings so far have been
 * Have they or will they try pair programming
 * Any challenges they've faced already after being in a group for a week

## D. Dictionaries

Write a python program `vowel.py` that takes in a series of words on a single line in from STDIN and outputs the frequency of how often each vowel appears. Assume all words passed in are lowercase.

## E. Git & Python

Do you have any lingering questions about git and python for your tutor?
